# DX11Starter-NI
DirectX11 Graphics Engine, based on starter code by Chris Cascioli

Personal additions to starter code:
*Movable Camera
*Shape Movement (required creation of Entity class)
*Lighting
*Fog
*Textures (required creation of Materials class)
*Shadows (Directional Light)

TO DO:
*Add shadow maps for Spot Lights
*Add working spot lights (duh)
*Normal Mapping
*any other effects that look cool
